        <description>I am very grateful and happy to share that I have successfully completed my CompTIA Security+ certification. It was indeed a remarkable experience to learn about different threats, tools and technologies that are used in the enterprise to defend against the bad guys from breaking in.
I would suggest this certification to anyone who is interested in pursuing a career in the InfoSec industry as it gives you a wider perspective and delves deep on certain technical topics.</description>
