        <description>Learning Linux is something a developer or every security enthusiast would love to do and master it one point in their career. The most common reasons for this include the wide spread use of the platform and ease of tools available for various use cases.

        <description>For long, penetration testers and security enthusiasts have been using tools that are natively built around the linux platform. There are few linux flavours dedicated entirely for this purpose. BackTrack, Kali and Parrot OS are few among them.
FireEye , a Cyber Security Solutions Provider, has released a new product which runs on top of the windows OS to install more than 140 tools including the most popular ones such as Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, Mimikatz, Hashcat etc.</description>

        <description>Cross Site Scripting (XSS) is one of the OWASP top 10 web application vulnerabilities. Although Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack has decreased (reference: OWASP 2017 ), it is one of the attack that is prominent for web applications. I recently came across an online lab Gruyere , which allows you to test and play around with XSS and CSRF attacks.</description>

        <description>The information security industry has plenty of recognised certifications. At one point or another, you‚Äôll come across a situation where you have to obtain a security certification. It could either be to enhance your knowledge or as a requirement for a particular job that you are aspiring for.
Doing an online research for pursuing a security certification, I came across SkillSet , a website that offers thousands of practice questions for some of the most commonly recognised security certifications.</description>
