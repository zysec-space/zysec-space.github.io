        <description>Hello there! Thank you for stopping by again. It has been a while since I updated my blog. Well, as you are already aware of the events happening around the globe, I have been (and am still) trying to hold myself up!
During the summer, I was working on my master&amp;rsquo;s thesis, which was an exercise of both, success and failure (more on this later)!</description>
