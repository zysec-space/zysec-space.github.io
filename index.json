Its popularity has grown so much so that it has become the second largest DNS resolver after Google.\nSince they have become very popular, on 1st April 2020, they have launched 1 dot for families. The primary objective of their new DNS resolvers are to filter out bad sites and to keep adult content from being accessed by kids. Their two new offerings are 1.1.1.2 (malware) and 1.1.1.3 (malware and adult content). If you\u0026rsquo;re using IPv4, then you can configure using these settings:\n Malware Blocking Only  Primary DNS: 1.1.1.2 Secondary DNS: 1.0.0.2   Malware and Adult Content  Primary DNS: 1.1.1.3 Secondary DNS: 1.0.0.3\n    If you\u0026rsquo;re using IPv6, then you can configure using these settings:\n Malware Blocking Only  Primary DNS: 2606:4700:4700::1112 Secondary DNS: 2606:4700:4700::1002   Malware and Adult Content  Primary DNS: 2606:4700:4700::1113 Secondary DNS: 2606:4700:4700::1003\n    During the current situation where many are confined to our homes and working remotely, these settings can provide a better security and enhance your privacy online.

The most common reasons for this include the wide spread use of the platform and ease of tools available for various use cases.\nI recently visited a website Linux Journey recommended by a friend, that helps in learning Linux. Since then, I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to follow along and refresh my Linux-fu as they call it. The journey is broken down into 3 main sections:\n Grasshopper Journeyman Networking nomad\n  These sections helps you start from basic Linux skills such as command line, text editing, user management and system processes to networking topics such as DNS, routing and subnetting on Linux. There are good examples to try out on our systems for hands own understanding and also features an exercise and a quiz section to test your understanding of a particular topic. The site also features references to other Linux learning resources.\nHope you find this site a good refresher to hone your Linux skills.\n"

	"content": "It‚Äôs been a while I had updated my blog. As time flew by, it was time for me to renew my website and so this post is going to be about upgrading ZySec.\nIf you visited the first version of my site, you could tell that it was hosted on Wordpress. As I was just starting with a domain and hosting, I was lucky to receive the introductory offers and chose managed Wordpress hosting as I knew that would help setup my site quickly.\nAs it was due for renewal, I wanted to explore my options. Given that my site doesn‚Äôt attract enough traffic, kept me wondering if I had to go with managed Wordpress hosting again. After doing a bit of research, the following were my choices:\nHosting: GitHub Pages With GitHub pages, we could host a static site or a blog that doesn‚Äôt require any database setup or server configurations. It also provides a free .github.io domain with enforced HTTPS (ikr ü§ì) among many other options.\nSite content: Hugo Framework Since ZySec is a static site, I decided to use a static site generator. The options were Hugo and Jekyll. After a little reading on reviews and pros/cons, I chose Hugo. I must admit that it wasn‚Äôt an easy learning curve, but definitely with time, it becomes easier.\nHugo also has a decent collection of themes to choose from. So after you‚Äôre sure which one to use, then you‚Äôre good to go. If you require more customisation, you can always develop your own theme or modify the code accordingly.\nEmail: Zoho Mail Although this is a new addition, I am extremely happy with it so far. The best part? It has a free plan that supports custom domain names and up to 5 user accounts. Setup was quite straightforward and didn‚Äôt take too long to complete. They have great documentation (+1 for that) and takes you through setting up SPF and DKIM If you don‚Äôt have a specific requirement or use case to go with any of the paid services, then these choices will definitely help you save a decent amount of money!\nIf you have any suggestions our other services that are better than the ones listed, let me know in the comments and I‚Äôll check them out.\nSpecial thanks/credits:\n Hugo theme: Zzo  Hugo tutorial on YouTube by Mike   "

	"content": "In the first cURL post, I wrote about how to download files using cURL. I recently got an opportunity to work with forms using cURL. In this post, I will describe about how I used cURL to send a POST request to page containing a form. The objective was to obtain the response from the server after submitting a form. The form contained three text boxes with id‚Äôs that could be used to submit the form using cURL. The man page for cURL has plenty of options that can be used to get this done. Hence going through the man page is highly advised.\nThe default request cURL performs is a POST request and hence it is not required in our code. However, it can be mentioned using -X option, to change in case of GET requests. (I like mentioning it, so that I know what has to be done in case of GET requests!) In order to submit data along with our request, we need to use ‚Äìdata or -d option to specify the fields, which can be separated by an \u0026amp; symbol and written together. If the data you want to insert contains special characters, you can use ‚Äìdata-urlencode option for that particular field. Assuming the three text boxes are id, name and age, the curl command will look like this: curl http://website.com/page.php -X POST --data \u0026quot;id=1\u0026quot; -d \u0026quot;name=Bob\u0026amp;age=15\u0026quot;\nThe server responds with a success message informing the data has been stored. If the server also requires you pass a cookie in order to perform this action, you can do so using the -b option for raw cookie data. If two cookies are required, it should be in the format ‚Äúcookie1=data1; cookie2=data2‚Äù If the = symbol is not used, it will treat that as filename where cookie details are specified. curl http://website.com/page.php -X POST -d \u0026quot;id=1\u0026quot; -d \u0026quot;name=Bob\u0026amp;age=15\u0026quot; -b \u0026quot;auth=user\u0026quot;\nThere are plenty of options with cookies including files, that are received from the server or a file that is being sent from the client side. In such cases, cookies can also be specified using the -c option. As mentioned earlier, going through the man page comes in handy in situations like these.\nHope some of these comes in handy to you when working with forms and playing around with cURL.\n"

	"content": "Crunch is a wordlist generator useful for password cracking. Sometimes, you don‚Äôt want to use large precomputed wordlists and instead you may want to create your own. Crunch is your solution! It is a small but powerful command line tool allowing you to specify the criteria for the wordlists and generate it for you.\nThe most common and useful features include minimum maximum length, pattern specification and resume capability [very handy when the input is large].\nCreate and save your wordlist to a file using the -o option. You can specify special patterns using -t option followed by any of these:\n% [percent] for numbers\n^ [caret] for 33 symbols: ! @ # $ % ^ \u0026amp; * ( ) ‚Äì _ + = ~ ` [ ] { } | \\ : ; ‚Äù ‚Äò \u0026lt; \u0026gt; , . ? / [space]\n@ [at] for lower case letters\n, [comma] for Upper case letters\nIf you wish to include any of these characters (% ^ @ ,) in your wordlist, you can do so by using the literal -l option [lowercase for L] along with -t option. Here are some examples:\n  Wordlist with 8 characters, using \u0026lsquo;abcdefgh\u0026rsquo;\ncrunch 7 8 abcdefgh -o eight_char.txt\nIn this example, crunch will generate a wordlist of 7 min characters, 8 maximum characters from these characters ‚Äòabcdefgh‚Äô.\n  Wordlist with specific characters at specific positions\ncrunch 8 8 -t a%b^c@d, -o special.txt\nIn this example, the characters a,b,c,d are fixed in those positions and will not change. Hence the output file will contain a1b!cadA upto a0b[space]czdZ\n  Wordlist with special characters\ncrunch 8 8 -t abcd,%@^ -l zzzz,z@z -o literals.txt\nIn the third example, special characters , and @ will not be replaced with uppercase and lowercase letters, instead they‚Äôll be treated as a literal character. Note that the length of -t and -l option should match and hence should be padded with some character (z in this case).\n  Wordlist with permutations\n\u2029crunch 1 1 -o possibilities.txt -p In Any Order\nIn the last example, different permutation of the words In, Any, Order will be output to the file. In this case, output will contain 6 lines. Here, we specify the min and max length as 1 as they are mandatory options for crunch.\n  The tool comes in built on Kali Linux. Although, on Windows, you cannot run crunch through command prompt, you can set it up by downloading the files SourceForge and installing them on a linux shell.\n"

The site didn‚Äôt allow to directly download all the files at once, but had to navigate to different pages to get the link to download the file. After downloading two files manually, I realised that the only difference between the files were, in their filenames with serial numbers ( file-001.mp3, file-002.mp3 \u0026amp; so on). A perfect use case for cURL to download the files, all at once! I decided not to search the internet on how to do it and instead opened the terminal and started reading the man page. Nothing fancy, -O (capital letter o) to save the file using the remote name, as stored in the server.\ncurl -O https://website.com/media/file-001.mp3\nFailed! The output was all zeroes. Tried navigating to the url through the browser to verify if the path is correct and it works perfect. Decided to try again ensuring to make no typos. Again, failed! Although my hands were itching to perform a google search to figure out the answer, decided to run through the manual one more time. Didn‚Äôt find anything helpful in particular but read something interesting about redirects with -L option. Even though I didn‚Äôt notice any redirects occurring on the webpage, decided to try it out before losing to the search engines.\ncurl -LO https://website.com/media/file-001.mp3\nYes! The file started downloading without any errors. Now to get the files in sequence, as stated in the manual surrounded them using [ ]\ncurl -LO https://website.com/media/file-[001-050].mp3\nBingo! Within a minute, all the 50 files were downloaded to the current working directory!\nI was quite happy to have found a use case and succeed in accomplishing it. It did save a plenty of time of navigating through each of those different pages to obtain the audio file.\nOne can learn more about cURL using the manual page or from their website .
